# Greetings, Crystal Collectors!

This game is a single-page application, using a few math-based JS methods to help randomize values in order to build a simple think-on-your-feet sort of point-and-click game. Users select one of four crystals from the line up and click. This adds a random value to their score. Repeat until user's score is either exactly equal to (the win condition!) or goes over (the lose condition) the goal score, which is also randomized each round.

## opportunities for improvement:
- Some games are unwinnable. Eliminating these would require much more complex parameters for the randomization ofthe Crystal and Bag values.
- Better mobile responsiveness
